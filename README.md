# Oh hello!

My name is Jayne! I am a nonbinary trans woman (she/they pronouns) and I'm a software engineer!

My professional developer skills include proficiency in Java and some experience with JS/TS, Ruby, Go, and C.

Hobbies outside of dev work include Mechanical Keyboards, Video Games, and 3D Printing. Sometimes all of these things mesh in very interesting ways, and I hope to capture some of that in some project work here.

If, for some reason, you’d like to contact me for project or nonprofessional work, you can message me on Discord (Jayne # 4024, no spaces).
